# Group Meeting: February 16, 2018

## Executive Summary
Members discussed ownership, governance, vision, and goals. Takeaways resulted in immediate organization of the Trello Board Community Enhancements. Members will use to organize teams and tasks and can change tools if teams agree.

Ownership and governance were the hottest topics. While still ideas we need to pin down and clarify as a community, especially with the concept of "ownership" of projects, we will likey need to continue to discuss this in following meetings to nail down the design.

> KyX:  
> From my own observation, it appeared to me that people were in favor of not guarding ideas if posted within the DS  ecosystem. Governance being accepted as a large project that might align itself with a bounty DApp created by DS members.  

## Meeting Agenda

**Topic #1 - Group Vision and Goals**
- Clearly define our group vision and goals (consider 1 year, 3 year, 5 year)
- What tasks should we avoid focusing on at this time?
- What tasks can move us closer to our goals?
- Break up goals into projects and assign project leaders (flows into topic #2 projects)

**Topic #2 - Governance, Rewards, and Incentives**
- Discuss what we want to achieve (don't focus too much on how for today)
- Appoint working group to research and implement governance models (learning project)
- Appoint working group to research and implement bounty incentive models (learning project)

## Define Group Vision and Goals

Overall everyone seemed to be on the same page about our visions for DappSociety. The following are contributions from those who are part of the discussion:

**BlockchainBud:**  
> "My initial goals were just to have a couple other people to work on a project with, but its clear now we can do a lot more than that. If participation devolved into that for months, I would be fine though."

**KyX:**  
> "Someone here stated the guiding light perfect IMO "DappSociety is a self-organizing, self-governing group dedicated to advancing the blockchain ecosystem."

**xzntorxz:**  
> "This community should be a supportive group of people that helps each other out, first by providing help with ideas and later their implementation"
> "I think its important that we have a loose government, that is able to create all kind of projects and is not too restricted"

**ericbrown99:**
> "I think of DappSociety as a collection of various projects, whether to learn or produce. There is a community wrapped around these projects to create a collective whole which provides help and assistance in forwarding these projects while also collaborating with the blockchain community"

**Livery614:**
> "My personal vision & goal is to learn more about blockchain and dapp ecosystem, then be part of at least one project (from ideas to implementation of product)
My perspective of DappSociety's vision is to create a autonomous and self organizing community that 
> 1) facilitates learning regarding blockchain and dapps
> 2) as a team(s) work on multiple projects with vision of launching one or more products"


We then decented slightly into the discussion about how someone who initially brings a project to the organization should proceed and how DappSociety should treat their ideas. We discussed many issues such as trust and ownership of projects which are presented, and after much discussion eventually decided that an idea itself can't necessarily be protected.  When presenting an Idea to DappSociety, its understood that it is then part of our open source community.  That being said, we will develop a *Code of Conduct* which outlines appropriate behavior within DappSociety to help protect the work and ideas of projects which are presently being worked on. We don't want to prevent "helpful/beneficial" hard forks but would like to prevent prevent malicious actors. 

## 1-3-5 Year Goals

As a reminder, it is human nature to over predict what we can do in 1 year, but we under predict what we can achieve in 3 years!

Our goals are ambitious, but achievable :)

Generally:
**BlockchainBud:**
>"If we produce projects, material comes out of that  
> If we produce material, the community expands  
> If the community expands, we produce more projects"

### Year 1:

* Produced content which benefits the blockchain community
* Created a environment which fosters learning and development of skills
* Educate ourselves and others on decentralized blockchain technologies
* Medium page with 5-10 articles published
* Several active project teams
* Actively partnering with other large initiatives (Such as reaching out to ConsenSys if we use the StandardBounties interface for our token rewards)
* 
 

### Year 3:

* Worldwide workshops
* Developed learning platform and resource database
* Publish a book



### Year 5:

* Become a well known consulting group for decentralized systems and blockchain technology


## Incentive Models
We briefly touched on incentive design for the DappSociety community and for its side projects: whether they should all be tokenized, share the same token or utilize different tokens, and how to develop a bounty and reputation system. This still needs to be significantly worked out
